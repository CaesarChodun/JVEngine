# JVEngine
<h2>Project resumed!</h2>
<p>After 4 months the project is finally resumed! I appologise for such a huge break, but I had to improved my knowledge of <b>Vulkan</b> before proceeding with developement of JVEngine. Now I'm ready to take this project to the next level, or at least to the new version ;)</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The aim of the project is to create simple <b>game engine</b> that is entirely based on <b>Vulkan</b> api.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p><b>Engine</b> is written in <b>Java</b> and is using <b>LWJGL 3</b>. So before you start you should install <b>Java</b> and set up required <b>LWJGL 3</b> libraries(see <b>Required LWJGL libraries</b> bellow).</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.2</h2>
<p>JVEngine is currently in an alfa stage and therefor many functionalities are not added yet. But I highly encourage people new to <b>Vulkan</b> to take a closer look at(at least) some functionalities of JVEngine. For example choosing the right physical device is often very confusing for many beginners, and JVEngine has this function already implemented!</p>

<h2>Required LWJGL libraries</h2>
<p> It is highly recomended to download default "Minimal Vulkan" preset with JOML selected. You can find it on this website:
https://www.lwjgl.org/. </p>

<h2>Contribute!</h2>
<p>Developing fully functional game engine is challenging enough for a team of full time developers. Not to say for a guy that is pursuing bechelor's degree at the same time(and hase some other projects too). So any amount of help is more then welcome!</p>
